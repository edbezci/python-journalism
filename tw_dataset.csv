Reuters,25-November-2019,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-election-idUSKBN1XZ0AP,Taiwan ruling party says China 'enemy of democracy' after meddling allegations,"4 Min ReadTAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s ruling party denounced China as an “enemy of democracy” on Monday following fresh claims of Chinese interference in the island’s politics ahead of presidential and legislative elections on Jan. 11. The allegations, reported by Australian media, were made by a Chinese asylum seeker in Australia who said he was a Chinese spy. China, which claims Taiwan as its sacred territory, to be brought under Beijing’s control by force if necessary, has branded the asylum seeker a fraud. The Chinese man, Wang Liqiang, also provided details of Chinese efforts to infiltrate universities and media in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, which has been rocked by months of anti-government protests.  Cho Jung-tai, chairman of Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan’s formal independence, said there needed to be further investigations, noting that a lot of fake news came from China. “The enemy of democracy is China. At present Taiwan’s most ambitious opponent, competitor, is also China,” Cho told a news conference in Taipei. Taiwan’s presidential office cited Tsai as saying on Monday that the allegations were being probed, and that people should not reach conclusions before a complete investigation was done. Among several allegations leveled, the would-be defector said he had helped guide positive media attention toward certain Taiwanese politicians, including President Tsai’s main opponent, Han Kuo-yu of the China-friendly Kuomintang party. The Kuomintang’s Han said he would drop out of the election if he has taken any money from the Chinese Communist Party.  Speaking at a separate news conference, Kuomintang’s spokeswoman Wang Hong-wei said the issue was one of “blundering Communist espionage” that should be investigated immediately, and accused the government of seeking to use the matter to “manipulate elections”. China’s state-backed Global Times tabloid said in a Monday opinion piece that Wang Liqiang sounded like an “opportunistic liar, probably a swindler”. Three Taipei-based diplomatic and security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters they also doubted whether Wang was who he claimed to be, though his allegations  were plausible. “Our assessment is he is most likely not who is says he is,” said one of the sources. Separately, Taiwan is investigating two directors of a Hong Kong-listed company which was named in the Australian reports as being involved in Communist Party infiltration of Hong Kong universities and media, the Justice Ministry’s Investigation Bureau said on Monday, without giving details. Wang said he was part of an intelligence operation working within Hong Kong-listed China Innovation Investment Limited to infiltrate Hong Kong universities and media with pro-Communist Party operatives to counter the territory’s democracy movement. In a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange earlier on Monday, the company said the reports were “all fictitious and forged” and that Wang had never worked there. The company said that it had received notification from Executive Director Xiang Xin and alternate Director Kung Ching that they had been about to leave Taipei Taoyuan Airport when Taiwanese investigators requested their cooperation in an “investigation on the matter of the news reports”. “In fact, Mr. Xiang and Mrs. Kung knew nothing about the issues exposed in the news reports,” the statement said. It said both directors had engaged Taiwan lawyers to provide assistance. It was not immediately clear who their lawyers were.  The company declined to provide further details beyond what was in the statement. Reporting by Ben Blanchard and Yimou Lee; editing by Simon Cameron-MooreAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Reuters,27-November-2019,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-election-banking-idUSKBN1Y115G,Taiwan asks banks to ensure enough dollars in case of election nerves,"3 Min ReadTAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s central bank has instructed two major foreign exchange banks on the island to bring in more U.S. dollars before the end of the year to prepare for increased demand in case of political uncertainty in January elections, two sources told Reuters. Taiwan holds presidential and legislative votes on Jan. 11. Opinion polls put President Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party far ahead of her main opponent Han Kuo-yu from the Kuomintang party, which favors close ties with China. China claims Taiwan as its sacred territory to be brought under Beijing’s control by force if necessary, and pays close attention to elections on the island. Beijing has in the past menaced Taiwan with war games to try and influence people not to vote for candidates viewed as pro-Taiwan independence, though such efforts have tended to backfire. Two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters that Taiwan’s central bank has instructed Mega Commercial Bank and Bank of Taiwan to import physical dollar bills - $30 million for Mega and $25 million for Bank of Taiwan. The two banks declined to comment.  A Taiwan central bank official said it was normal to ask banks to ensure they had ample U.S. dollars ahead of elections. The sources added that the import volume was less than the last presidential election in 2016, as the central bank assessed that the banks’ dollar cash reserves were still abundant. Taiwan usually stocks sufficient dollars ahead of elections to ensure it can meet demand if there is tension or political uncertainty with China, in case Taiwanese have to leave the island fast or the currency plunges in the event of a crisis. Ahead of the 1996 elections, when China fired missiles into the Taiwan Strait, some Taiwanese rushed to buy gold. China sailed an aircraft carrier group through the Taiwan Strait earlier this month, a move Taiwan denounced as attempted intimidation. China has made little secret of its dislike of Tsai. Taiwan has a large current account surplus and substantial foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $472.48 billion at the end of October, the sixth largest in the world.  Reporting by Liang-sa Loh; Writing by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Andrew CawthorneAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Reuters,28-November-2019,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-election-china-idUSKBN1Y20CY,"China holds out carrot ahead of Taiwan election, but few convinced","4 Min ReadTAIPEI (Reuters) - China is stepping up efforts to be nice to Taiwan ahead of key elections on Jan. 11, offering better treatment to Taiwanese in China and urging the democratic island to “come home”, but many there only see Beijing wielding a threatening stick. China denies interfering in elections in Taiwan, which Beijing claims as sacred territory, but it traditionally tries various means to influence their result, hoping politicians with a more positive view on China ties get into office. These can range from military intimidation - China fired missiles into the Taiwan Strait before the 1996 election - to what Taiwan’s government calls Beijing’s manipulation of China-friendly Taiwanese media. China also wants to ensure that Taiwan’s huge business community in China is happy, hoping they will go home to vote for China-friendly politicians. This month, China unveiled 26 measures to further open its economy to investors from Taiwan, and said Taiwanese abroad could turn to Chinese embassies for consular help. Dovetailing with those steps has been an unusual Chinese effort at soft power to speak directly to people in Taiwan, a gentler approach after some hostile moves this year, such as a threat of force by President Xi Jinping in January. Commenting on the 26 measures, Hai Xia, one of the highest-profile news presenters on Chinese state television, appealed for Taiwan to return “home”. “Taiwan’s fate is connected with the motherland. Wan Wan, come home,” she said on air, employing a diminutive to refer to Taiwan and project a friendly message. China has not only been using Mandarin, the official tongue on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, but has also deployed Hokkien and Hakka, two languages spoken on the island but whose formal use is not encouraged in China. On Wednesday, it introduced Zhu Fenglian, a new spokeswoman for its policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, who voiced warm greetings in both languages at her first news conference.  “I am a Hakka from Guangdong, I’d like first here to say hello to folks in Taiwan,” she said, referring to the southern Chinese province while speaking in Hokkien, generally known in Taiwan as Taiwanese.  Many politicians in Taiwan, a rambunctious democracy, have responded vigorously to China’s gestures. Beijing should focus on “giving its own people a bit more freedom”, Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Twitter in response to China’s 26 measures, writing in the simplified Chinese characters used in China and not Taiwan.         The Chinese state television comment on “coming home” also triggered a backlash. “Thank you for your concern; the people of Taiwan are already in their own home,” independent legislator Hung Tzu-yung wrote on her Facebook page.  China was the “enemy of democracy”, Cho Jung-tai, chairman of the ruling pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has repeatedly warned of the threat China poses, said this week.  Even Taiwan’s main opposition party, the Kuomintang, which favours closer ties, has been cautious of being too closely associated with Beijing in an election year. Commenting on the new measures for Taiwanese in China, the Kuomintang welcomed their beneficial content.  “But if any of these actions belittle the sovereignty of the Republic of China, it must be firmly opposed,” it warned, using Taiwan’s official name. “The Kuomintang hopes both sides of the Taiwan Strait will give priority to each other’s livelihoods and not hurt the rights and interests of the people on both sides for momentary election considerations.” (This story corrects party affiliation of legislator in paragraph 15, removes reference to New Power Party) Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Yimou Lee; Editing by Clarence FernandezAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Reuters,13-November-2019,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-taiwan-idUSKBN1XN0C9,China says Taiwan scaremongering with attack talk,"3 Min ReadBEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday Taiwan was scaremongering with talk of a possible Chinese attack, after Taiwan’s foreign minister said Beijing could resort to military conflict to divert domestic pressure if an economic slowdown bites. As Taiwan’s presidential elections approach in January, China has stepped up a campaign to “reunify” with what it considers a wayward province, wooing away the island’s few diplomatic allies and flying regular bomber patrols around it. And President Xi Jinping said in January that China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control but will strive to achieve peaceful “reunification”. Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told Reuters last week that China could attack the democratic and self-ruled island if  any threat to China’s ruling Communist Party arises from social pressures that could result from any slowdown in the world’s second largest economy amid a trade war with the United States. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, told a regular news conference in Beijing that Wu’s comments were “complete nonsense and absolute rubbish”. “Recently, in order to seek benefit for the elections, they have been weaving various lies to intimidate, threaten and mislead the people of Taiwan,” he added.  “I think compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait must be highly vigilant and not easily misled.” China’s economy is fine, Ma said. “Under the current complicated economic situation, the mainland’s economic development landscape is still good, and this is not something the likes of Joseph Wu can talk down.” China’s economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30-year low this year, putting the onus on Beijing to step up stimulus needed to sustain growth. Ma said China wants “peaceful reunification”, while Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party is the real greatest threat to peace, pushing independence and inciting enmity. Taiwan was trying to “cover up” the island’s own economic problems, Ma added.  Taiwan’s economy grew at its fastest pace in more than a year in the third quarter, as a rebound in demand for tech products for the year-end peak season boosted manufacturers and “offset” the impact of trade disputes. Ma separately confirmed that three people from Taiwan who had been reported missing in China were being investigated on suspicion of harming national security. He gave no details.

Reuters,24-November-2019,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-election-idUSKBN1XY01J,China meddling allegations roil Taiwan election campaign,"4 Min ReadTAIPEI (Reuters) - Election campaigning in Taiwan was hit at the weekend by new allegations that Beijing had tried to meddle in the island’s politics. A Chinese defector, named as Wang “William” Liqiang by Australian media, gave a sworn statement to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, or ASIO, about Beijing’s efforts to influence politics in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia. In particular, Wang said he helped guide positive media attention toward certain Taiwanese politicians, including President Tsai Ing-wen’s main opponent, Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang party. Han said that he would drop out if it was shown that he had taken money from China’s Communist Party. China said in a statement on Saturday that Wang is a convicted fraudster who held fake travel documents. Taiwan, claimed by China as its territory to be brought under Beijing’s control by force if needed, is already on high alert for Chinese attempts to sway presidential and legislative elections scheduled for Jan. 11, whether through disinformation campaigns or military intimidation. “Taiwan was the most important work of ours: the infiltration into media, temples, and grassroots organizations,” Wang said through a translator in a televised interview on Australia’s Channel 9 “60 Minutes” program on Sunday. The details about what China is suspected of doing in Taiwan quickly provoked strong reaction from both Han and his party and Tsai and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan’s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Speaking on a campaign stop in eastern Taiwan on Saturday, Tsai said China’s “shadow” was becoming more and more obvious. Taiwan must not let China destroy its democratic values, she added. Deputy Foreign Minister Szu-chien Hsu said in an interview with Australia’s Channel 9 on Sunday that Taiwan was facing “multiple” threats from China. “Xi Jinping is to disrupt us and undermine our credibility and decrease our citizens’ trust in government,” he said.  DPP Chairman Cho Jung-tai, writing on his Facebook page, said the Kuomintang was teaming up with the Chinese Communist Party against Taiwan and urged people to use their vote wisely. “Will one ballot decide whether Taiwan wants to go into totalitarian China with the Kuomintang?” Cho wrote. The Kuomintang called the reports in the Australian media “quite sensational”, adding it hoped the government did not use this to “play the fear of the communist’s card”. Han told reporters he had doubts about what the defector was claiming, asking how the Kuomintang lost the last presidential election in 2016 if China really was swaying elections. If he had taken money from China’s Communist Party, Han said he resign from his post as mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung, to which he was elected a year ago.  “In this year’s presidential election, if Han Kuo-yu has taken even one cent, he will immediately drop out of the race,” Han told reporters, adding he needed more information. “Can Mr. Wang please come directly to Taiwan, and not hide overseas.” China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said a statement that Beijing was not intervening in Taiwan’s election, and called accusations to the contrary “nonsense”. Taiwan’s government says it is investigating Wang’s claims, and is asking Australia to provide further information.    Chiang Kai-shek and his Kuomintang fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Chinese Communist Party.  While no peace treaty has ever been signed, Kuomintang delegations these days visit China regularly. Han met the head of China’s Taiwan Affairs Office in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen in March. (Corrects paragraph five to say held, not traveled on, fake documents.)

Reuters,04-November-2019,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-taiwan-idUSKBN1XE0YV,"China offers more access for Taiwan firms, Taiwan warns of a trap","3 Min ReadBEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China unveiled measures on Monday to further open its markets to firms from self-ruled Taiwan, including capital raising, as Taiwan warned its people not to be taken in by moves at “enticement” ahead of a January presidential election. China claims democratic Taiwan as its own and has stepped up pressure on the strategically located island since President Tsai Ing-wen assumed office in 2016, fearing she wishes to push for its formal independence, a red line for Beijing. As well as flying regular patrols of air force jets around Taiwan and forcing foreign companies to refer to Taiwan as part of China on their websites, Beijing has targeted Taiwanese firms in what it says are steps to make their life easier in China. Taiwan says this has political aims. In the latest measures, China will allow Taiwan firms to invest in, or participate in, projects ranging from 5G to civil aviation, and allow Taiwan companies to issue bonds to raise capital on the inter-bank market, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement. China will also make it easier for Taiwanese to live and work in the country and offer Taiwan citizens abroad the right to seek consular help from Chinese embassies, which in practice China has already been doing as it considers them Chinese citizens. Responding, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said China was doing this to try to push its agenda of “promoting reunification, enticing Taiwan, and trying to split apart Taiwan internally, showing they are trying to influence Taiwan’s elections”. Those who go to China need to be aware of the risks and the “differences in the system”, the council added.  Taiwan companies have flocked to China since the two sides begun a detente in the 1980s, attracted by far lower costs and a common language and culture. The latest steps follow on from rules issued last year to make life easier for Taiwan people and companies in China, which says it genuinely wants to help them.  Taiwan fears China is trying to “absorb Taiwan’s resources” and foster pro-China sentiment on the island, ultimately getting people to vote for China-friendly parties. China has further pressured Tsai, who is up for re-election in January, her by whittling away Taiwan’s last remaining diplomatic allies, most recently the Solomon Islands and Kiribati. Tsai says she will not be bullied by Beijing and will defend Taiwan’s security and democratic way of life. Reporting by Ben Blanchard and Yimou LeeAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Reuters,28-November-2019,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-china-idUSKBN1Y219R,"Taiwan pushes anti-infiltration bill, opposition cries foul","3 Min ReadTAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan needs to have legal means to prevent China interfering in its politics, a government spokesman said on Thursday about a anti-infiltration law that is being drafted, as the main opposition said it feared being “painted red” by the law. The legislation is part of a years-long effort to combat what many in Taiwan see as Chinese efforts to influence politics and the democratic process on the island. China claims Taiwan as its territory, to be brought under Beijing’s control by force if necessary. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party has begun a renewed push for the legislation this week, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan. 11. They say there is extra urgency following allegations from a Chinese asylum seeker in Australia, Wang Liqiang, who told media there he was a spy who had worked to spread Communist Party influence in Hong Kong and meddle in Taiwan politics. Chiu Chui-cheng, deputy head of Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, said China’s infiltration and interference in Taiwan was “extremely severe”. Other democracies take legal steps to stop such activities, and Taiwan must do so too, especially due to “China’s unwillingness to give up on annexing Taiwan, while using Taiwan’s free and open environment to create division within society”, Chiu told reporters. “We are right at the frontline of external threats and thus have an even more urgent need to strengthen the legal system to safeguard national security and the future of freedom and democracy.” China has denied meddling in Taiwan, and says supposed spy Wang is a convicted fraudster who has made “absurd” claims. Taiwan’s main opposition party the Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China, has expressed serious doubts about Wang’s allegations, criticizing the DPP for using the accusations to seek electoral gain and smear their presidential candidate, Han Kuo-yu. Speaking earlier on Thursday at a parliamentarian hearing regarding the law initiative, Charles Chen, who is running as a Kuomintang legislator, called the planned legislation a “political tool” for the administration of President Tsai Ing-wen to gain votes. “Are they using the case of Wang Liqiang to rush the legislation, and paint the Kuomintang red?” he said, referring to the color of the Chinese Communist Party. “The legislation could easily become a political tool, especially during the elections,” Chen added. Kuomintang presidential hopeful Han said this week he would sue Wang if he ever came to Taiwan.

It asked its citizens not to worry and revealed that US and Japanese ships were also following the Chinese ships.The voyage coincided with an announcement by Tsai Ing-wen, the Taiwanese president, naming her running mate, William Lai for the January poll, prompting Taipei to immediately hit back at Beijing’s perceived motivations.“Just as @iingwen names her running mate & the campaign shifts into high gear, #PLA sends its new 002 aircraft carrier battle group into the #TaiwanStrait. #PRC intends to intervene in #Taiwan's elections. Voters won't be intimidated! They'll say NO to #Chinaat the ballot box,” said Joseph Wu, Taiwan’s foreign minister on Twitter.China has ambitions to annex Taiwan, which functions like any other nation with its own currency, military, government and democratic elections.Beijing has taken a hostile stance towards President Tsai since she came to power in 2016 for her refusal to agree that Taiwan and China are part of the same country, and is suspicious of her close relations with the US.  Taipei has accused Beijing multiple times in the past few months of trying to sway the election – by poaching from its small group of remaining formal diplomatic allies and by switching off lucrative income from Chinese tourists.China’s display came just a few days after the USS Chancellorsville, a guided missile cruiser, made a similar transit, in a move that likely irked Beijing, which views such voyages as meddling in its affairs with Taiwan.© Telegraph Media Group Limited 2019We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions

Reuters,22-November-2019,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-usa-china-idUSKBN1XW0A0,U.S. says concerned about China's attempts to influence Taiwan's presidential vote,"4 Min ReadTAIPEI (Reuters) - The United States is concerned about China’s attempts to influence Taiwan’s presidential and parliamentary elections, the top U.S. official in Taiwan said on Friday, as China stepped up pressure on the self-ruled island ahead of the vote in January.       The comment came days after Taiwan denounced China for trying to interfere in its democratic process ahead of the Jan. 11 polls, including sailing an aircraft carrier group through the Taiwan Strait on Sunday. “We are aware that China is attempting to apply pressure through various means on Taiwan. Certainly, these attempts to influence Taiwan’s democratic process are of concern,” said Brent Christensen, the de facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan.  “We believe that malign actors are using disinformation campaigns to make people lose faith in democratic institutions,” he told reporters in Taipei.  Beijing has in recent months stepped up efforts to “reunify” what it considers a wayward province, flying regular bomber patrols around it and seeking to isolate it diplomatically. The United States, like most countries, has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but is bound by law to help provide the island with the means to defend itself. It is democratic Taiwan’s strongest backer on the international stage. Christensen said any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including boycotts or embargoes, was of “grave concern” to the United States. Taiwan and the United States have very close ties, he added, noting this year’s $10 billion in U.S. arms sales to the island. “We have, I believe, a strong relationship in security matters that we anticipate will only grow stronger.” Speaking later in the day, Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said China’s military threat was growing. “China’s military preparation against Taiwan has not been slowing down. In fact, it’s been intensifying,” he told reporters.        President Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party is leading in the polls, ahead of her main rival, Han Kuo-yu of the China-friendly Kuomintang party. Tsai’s government has repeatedly warned of Beijing’s campaign to influence the vote, including snatching more of Taiwan’s few remaining diplomatic allies and a “warfare” of disinformation to mislead voters.   Chinese President Xi Jinping said in January that China reserved the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control but would strive to achieve peaceful “reunification”. [nL3N1Z20JT] Beijing suspects Tsai of pushing for the island’s formal independence, which Xi has warned would lead to a “grave disaster”.  China described the carrier sailing as routine and not aimed at anyone in particular, dismissing Taiwan’s complaints. Taiwan has lost seven diplomatic allies to China since Tsai took office in 2016, leaving 15 nations that recognize the island.   China has sent about 2,000 bomber patrols a year to the narrow Taiwan Strait separating the two sides, the island’s defense minister, Yen Teh-fa, told parliament last week.

The company, China Innovation Investment Ltd, said on Monday executive director Xiang Xin and alternate director Kung Ching had been stopped at Taipei’s main airport and asked to cooperate in a probe into Australian media reports about Chinese interference in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The allegations were made by a Chinese asylum seeker in Australia, Wang Liqiang, who said he was a Chinese spy. China says the man is a convicted fraudster. Wang said he was part of an intelligence operation working within China Innovation Investment to infiltrate Hong Kong universities and media with pro-Communist Party operatives to counter the territory’s democracy movement. He also gave details about Chinese efforts to meddle in Taiwan’s political system and elections.  The company said the reports were “fictitious and forged” and that Wang had never been an employee. Hong Kong has been rocked by months of anti-government protests. Xiang and Kung were referred to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office on Monday night for further investigation on suspicion of violating the National Security Act, office spokeswoman Chen Yu-ping said by telephone. They have also been ordered not to leave Taiwan, she said. The pair was being probed on suspicion of “developing an organization” for foreign forces including the Chinese government, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, Chen said.  “The two litigants were very cooperative ... We are looking into the purpose of their visit,” she said, adding that the pair made frequent travels to Taiwan.  The company declined comment on Tuesday, and referred to its corporate filings. It said on Monday the two executives were staying Taiwan to cooperate with the investigation and had retained Taiwan lawyers, but it was not immediately clear who they were. Xiang, a science and technology graduate from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, is the chairman of another Hong Kong-listed company, China Trends Holdings Ltd.    China Trends Holdings and China Innovation Investment in 2010 signed an MoU with a company run by major state-backed Chinese defense manufacturer China North Industries Group Corporation - also known as Norinco - to build parts for electric cars, corporate filings show. Taiwan’s Investment Commission, which is under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said on Monday the two executives had applied in December 2016 to invest T$100 million ($3.27 million) to set up a real estate company. However, Taiwan rejected the application in April 2017 due to national security considerations, it said. Chang Min-pin, the commission’s executive secretary, told Reuters that Taiwan’s defense ministry advised against the investment proposal, citing concerns over Xiang’s Norinco links. Kung’s former post with Beijing-based China Defence Science and Technology Information Centre also raised concerns, he said. China Innovation Investment’s company profile on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange website says it is a Kong-based investment holding company “principally engaged in the investment in dual usage of military and civil sectors”.  “The company’s investments mainly include military and civil dual-used charge storage batteries, new models of lighting products, eco-equipment materials and energy-saving media terminals,” it added.  The company’s Hong Kong-listed stock price fell more than 6% on Tuesday. It was not clear if the company has operations in Taiwan.     Taiwan, claimed by China as its sacred territory, is already on high alert for Chinese attempts at disinformation and intimidation ahead of Jan. 11 elections for the presidency and legislature. President Tsai Ing-wen, who’s seeking re-election in January, urged citizens in August to stay on alert for Chinese-financed media “infiltration” after a Reuters report of a Beijing-backed media campaign to purchase press coverage on the island. Beijing has been cultivating networks of supporters in Taiwan and ramping up campaigns to lure Taiwanese with lucrative business opportunities ahead of the key elections, Reuters reported in June.

Yahoo.com,23-November-2019,https://news.yahoo.com/self-confessed-chinese-spy-spills-045237789.html,Self-confessed Chinese spy spills secrets in Australia,"PERTH, Australia (AP) — A self-confessed Chinese spy has given Australia's counterespionage agency inside intelligence on how Beijing conducts its interference operations abroad and revealed the identities of China’s senior military intelligence officers in Hong Kong, media reported.Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters Saturday that the detailed accusations of China infiltrating and disrupting democratic systems in Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan are “very disturbing.”The Nine network newspapers reported that Chinese defector Wang ""William"" Liqiang told ASIO — the country’s counterespionage agency — that he was involved in the kidnapping in 2015 of one of five Hong Kong booksellers suspected of selling dissident materials. The incident has been a reference point for protesters during the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong.He would be the first Chinese intelligence operative to blow his cover.“I have personally been involved and participated in a series of espionage activities,” Wang reportedly said in a sworn statement to ASIO in October.He revealed that he was part of a Hong Kong-based investment firm that was a front for the Chinese government to conduct political and economic espionage in Hong Kong, including infiltrating universities and directing harassment and cyberattacks against dissidents.Using a South Korean passport, Wang said he meddled in Taiwan’s 2018 municipal elections and claimed there were plans to disrupt the democratic self-ruled island’s presidential election in January.He said he helped funnel around 20 million yuan ($2.8 million) of campaign donations to Han Kuo-yu, mayor of the Taiwanese port city of Kaohsiung and a presidential candidate who has vowed to make peace with China.Han vehemently denied the allegations in a statement released by his campaign.“Forget about 20 million yuan,” Han said. “I would resign as Kaohsiung mayor if I had taken even 1 yuan from the Communist Party.”Communist Party-ruled China claims Taiwan as its territory to be reunited by force if necessary.Wang said he faced detention and possible execution if he returned to China.He said he currently was living in Sydney with his wife and infant son on a tourist visa and had requested political asylum.Australia’s Home Affairs Department told The Associated Press that it does not comment on individual cases.“The purpose of protection visas is to safeguard people who cannot return to their home country due to a well-founded fear of persecution or risk of harm,” a spokesperson said. “Each case is assessed on its merits.”In Beijing, China’s Foreign Ministry did not respond Saturday to a faxed request for comment on Wang.In Hong Kong, calls to the China Innovation Investment Limited office went unanswered Saturday. The company was identified by Wang as a front for Chinese intelligence operations in the city.According to its website, CIIL is an investment holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands in February 2002 and listed on Hong Kong’s stock exchange in August the same year. It has investments in several companies in Hong Kong and China that are involved in energy storage products, lightning products, energy saving and media terminals.Resource-rich Australia relies on China for one-third of its export earnings, but relations have been frosty for some time.The Australian government has been trying to neutralize China's influence by banning foreign political donations and all covert foreign interference in domestic politics.""These are very disturbing reports,” Frydenberg said. “The matter is now in the hands of the appropriate law enforcement agencies.”“The government makes no apologies for the strong measures that we've taken to ensure that we have foreign interference laws in place,” he added. “We will always stand up for our national interest whether it's on matters of foreign policy, foreign investments or other related issues.”Former ASIO boss Duncan Lewis warned Friday that the Chinese government was seeking a “takeover” of Australia's political system.Prime Minister Scott Morrison dismissed such concerns, saying that national intelligence agencies were on top of any threats.Last week, Liberal Party members Sen. James Paterson and Rep. Andrew Hastie said they had been barred entry to China for a study trip because of their criticism of the Chinese government.___Associated Press writers Eileen Ng in Hong Kong and Yanan Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.","A self-confessed Chinese spy has given Australia's counterespionage agency inside intelligence on how Beijing conducts its interference operations abroad and revealed the identities of China’s senior military intelligence officers in Hong Kong, media reported…"
Reuters,07-November-2019,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-diplomacy-china-idUSKBN1XH0H5,Taiwan warns of possible attack if China's slowdown 'becomes serious',"5 Min ReadTAIPEI (Reuters) - Beijing could resort to military conflict with self-ruled Taiwan to divert domestic pressure if a slowdown in the world’s second largest economy amid trade war threatens the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party, the island’s foreign minister has said. As Taiwan’s presidential elections approach in January, China has stepped up a campaign to “reunify” with what it considers a wayward province, wooing away the island’s few diplomatic allies and flying regular bomber patrols around it.   In an interview with Reuters, Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu drew attention to China’s slowing economy amid its bitter trade war with the United States.  “If the internal stability is a very serious issue, or economic slowdown has become a very serious issue for the top leaders to deal with, that is the occasion that we need to be very careful,” Wu said on Wednesday. “We need to prepare ourselves for the worst situation to come...military conflict.” China’s economy, though still growing, is expected to slow to a near 30-year low this year, underscoring a stiff challenge for Beijing in stepping up stimulus to keep up growth that has been fundamental to the Communist Party’s political legitimacy.  Wu said the economic situation in China was “OK” at the moment, but urged other countries to watch for what he saw as problems there, such as unemployment and popular discontent.      “Perhaps Xi Jinping himself is called into question of his legitimacy, by not being able to keep the Chinese economy growing,” Wu said, referring to China’s president. “This is a factor that might cause the Chinese leaders to decide to take an external action to divert domestic attention.” China’s growing military aggression in the region has become a “very serious” source of tension, Wu said, affecting many countries, but added that Taiwan was trying whatever it could to ensure peace across the Strait. “We certainly hope that Taiwan and China could live peacefully together, but we also see there are problems caused by China, and we will try to deal with it.”   Taiwan has lost seven diplomatic allies to China since President Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016. Beijing suspects Tsai of pushing for the island’s formal independence, which Xi has warned would lead to a “grave disaster”. Tsai has repeatedly said she will not change the status quo.  Months-long anti-government protests in Hong Kong have provided a lesson for Taiwan, said Wu, who has been a vocal supporter of democracy in the Asian financial hub.  The protests in the former British colony have posed the biggest populist challenge to Xi since he came to power in 2012. “People here understand that there’s something wrong (with)the way the ‘one country, two systems’ model is run in Hong Kong...Taiwan people don’t like to be in the same situation,” Wu said.  Beijing has repeatedly proposed to rule Taiwan under a “one country, two systems” formula similar to that prevailing in Hong Kong, guaranteeing certain freedoms, but the island has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China. Wu vowed to help Hong Kong people “striving for freedom and democracy”, promising that, if needed, Taiwan would “provide some assistance to them on an individual basis”. He did not elaborate, except for saying Taiwan would not intervene in the protests. Wu, who described his post as “the most difficult ministerial job in the world,” has seen five countries switch diplomatic ties to China, whose complaints also drove many global firms to alter their descriptions of Taiwan. “Acknowledging that Taiwan is part of China in exchange for some diplomatic space - I believe such a condition is unacceptable,” Wu said. “Taiwan’s diplomacy shouldn’t be outsourced to China.” China could snatch more of Taiwan’s remaining 15 diplomatic allies, Wu added, in a bid to influence the elections, at which Tsai is seeking re-election. “We are working closely with the United States and other like-minded countries to make sure the switch of diplomatic relations doesn’t happen again.” Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help defend it.

Reuters,05-November-2019,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-taiwan-idUSKBN1XF1HG,China says will 'fully respect' Taiwan's way of life,"3 Min ReadBEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China will “fully respect” Taiwan’s way of life and social system once it has been “peacefully reunified”, as long as national security is protected, the ruling Communist Party said on Tuesday, in another overture to the self-ruled island. China claims democratic Taiwan as its own and has stepped up pressure on the strategically located island since President Tsai Ing-wen assumed office in 2016, fearing she wishes to push for its formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Taiwan, which holds presidential elections in January, has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China. In a statement on the decisions reached at a key meeting of the party’s leadership last week known as a plenum, the party said it would firmly push for the country’s “peaceful reunification” and “promote institutional arrangements for peaceful development”. “Under the premise of ensuring national sovereignty, security, and development interests, after peaceful reunification, the social system and way of life of Taiwan compatriots will be fully respected,” it said. “Private property, religious beliefs, and legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan compatriots will be fully protected.” China has not explained how Taiwan’s democracy may be allowed to continue if it takes control of the island. On Monday, China unveiled measures to further open its markets to firms from self-ruled Taiwan, including raising capital, and to make life easier for people from Taiwan both in China and abroad, including offering them consular protection. Taiwan responded by warning its people not to be taken in by China’s efforts at “enticement” ahead of the election. Tsai said earlier on Tuesday that China was trying to influence the election and force it to accept “one country, two systems”, referring to the high degree of autonomy China says it grants unrest-racked Hong Kong and wants Taiwan to eventually accept. “There is only one answer to this - impossible,” Tsai said. Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry also weighed in. “Taiwan is a sovereign nation. The consular affairs we offer our citizens do not concern the PRC and we do not require them to act in our stead,” it said on its Facebook page, referring to China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China.  China translates the word “tong yi” as “reunification”, but it can also be translated as “unification”, a term in English preferred by supporters of Taiwan independence who point out that Beijing’s Communist government has never ruled Taiwan and so it cannot be “reunified”.

Oscar-winning film director Ang Lee is, once again, chairing the festival. While the mainland will be unrepresented and a major sponsor has pulled out, movie experts say the ceremony itself could still benefit.Chris Berry, professor of film studies at King’s College London, who has studied Chinese and East Asian cinema and screen cultures, said that the ban would mean the awards would get “even more attention than usual” going well beyond those with a special interest in Chinese film.“It's a worldwide news item, a whole new set of people will be interested,” Berry told Al Jazeera.Relations between Taiwan and mainland China, which sees the island as its own, have deteriorated as the democratic island prepares for elections in January and China asserts its claims over the South China Sea. Protracted protests in support of democracy in Hong Kong have also darkened the political mood.The Golden Horse Awards were started in 1962 to encourage Hong Kong filmmakers to produce Mandarin-speaking features as a means of supporting the Nationalists, who had established a government on Taiwan (known officially as the Republic of China) after the Communists won the civil war in 1949, said Daw-Ming Lee, director of the MFA in film, television and digital media at the Hong Kong Baptist University’s Academy of Film.But when films began to be recognised for their artistic achievements and creativity, and the event was opened to all Chinese-language filmmakers in the mid-1990s, the ceremony acquired increasing significance for the industry.“The Golden Horse Awards certainly is well-known to all cinéastes of Chinese-speaking films around the globe,” Lee said. “It has put Taiwan on the world's cinema map.”In last year’s ceremony, Chinese drama film An Elephant Sitting Still directed by the late Hu Bo won “Best Feature Film” while veteran Chinese director Zhang Yimou’s martial arts epic Shadow was nominated in 12 categories.But the glamour was overshadowed by politics after 36-year-old Taiwanese director Fu Yue, winner of the “Best Documentary” for Our Youth in Taiwan took to the stage.Her film featured two students who had taken part in Taiwan’s 2014 Sunflower Movement, when protesters occupied the island’s parliament opposing a trade deal with China amid fears of Beijing’s increasing influence on Taipei.“I really hope one day our country will be regarded as an independent entity,” she said as she accepted the award. “This is my biggest wish as a Taiwanese.”The mention of independence triggered upset among the mainland contingent.China-born Singapore-based actress Gong Li, who was the chief judge, refused to join Ang Lee on stage to present the award for best feature film.Raising the political temperature further, mainland actor Tu Men then referred to Taiwan as “Taiwan, China” angering many Taiwanese.This August, China’s state film regulator China Film Administration said mainland Chinese filmmakers would not be participating in this year’s awards.No specific reason was given.China Daily writer Zhang Zhouxiang blamed the organisers for allowing Fu to 'politicise' the event by talking about independence.""The deeds of certain pro-independence activists from Taiwan have ruined the reputation of their own festival,"" Zhang wrote.Last month, Italian luxury carmaker Maserati took to Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, to pull its support for the event.Maserati said its initial sponsorship was the work of its Taipei office, did not represent the company’s official position, and that it respected “China’s territorial integrity, history and culture”. It also pledged to uphold the “one-China principle.”Maserati did not respond to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment.Mainland media also reported luxury jeweller Bulgari and Chinese smartphone manufacturer OPPO also pulled their sponsorship.Golden Horse organisers did not respond to Al Jazeera’s questions on the issue.While there are no mainland films in the running this year, entries from other parts of the world where there are large Chinese-speaking communities, including Malaysia and Singapore, have increased.Malaysian-made The Garden of Evening Mists based on the 2012 Booker Prize-nominated novel of the same name is competing for “Best Narrative Feature”. So is Wet Season, a production from Singapore.In the “Best Documentary” category, Malaysian documentary The Tree Remembers, an exploration of racism, is aiming for the prize this year.Lee expects more Chinese-language films made in Southeast Asian countries – including films made in Cambodia and Myanmar which are China’s closest allies in the region – to participate in future Golden Horse Awards. He also expects Chinese-language filmmakers in Europe to enter their productions.Lee also noted the emergence of younger filmmakers.“A rather large proportion of films in the finalist [list] are made by emerging filmmakers from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asian countries,” he told Al Jazeera.“These young filmmakers, mostly in their 20s and 30s, are the future of Chinese-language films,” he added.The Golden Horse Awards have become a major soft power event for Taiwan, and even with the withdrawal of the mainland’s film industry there is little competition for its crown as the industry’s most-prestigious event, analysts said.“For many years, the Golden Horse Awards have been known as the leading awards in the Chinese-speaking world, because they have always been the most prominent awards available to Chinese filmmakers from more than one polity,” Berry told Al Jazeera.“I don’t see a People’s Republic of China event with similar credibility yet, so it will be difficult for them to take over from Golden Horse,” he said.China started its own Communist Party-backed film ceremony, known as the Golden Rooster Awards, in 1981 while Hong Kong began the annual Hong Kong Film Awards a year later. China has scheduled this year's Golden Roosters for this weekend.Lee said while it was “a bit regrettable” that this year’s Golden Horse Awards would take place without the participation of quality films from China, the publicity the decision had generated could also have a positive impact.“If it takes the boycott by Communist China for the Awards to become more international, so be it,” he said.“The ban from the PRC government has actually promoted the Awards' status as a genuine film awards for all Chinese-language films.”

Han Kuo-yu, standing on the presidential ticket for the Kuomintang party which favors close ties with China, is running a double-digit deficit in opinion polls behind President Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).  Han told reporters late on Thursday there were “many really strange polls” and even “fake polls” and people should refuse to answer calls from pollsters. However, writing on his Facebook page on Friday, Han said people should simply tell pollsters they were supporting Tsai. “From now on if you get a opinion poll call keep saying ‘(I) only support Tsai Ing-wen,” he wrote. “Together we can make the DPP happy until Jan. 10, 2020!” Senior DPP legislator Lo Chih-cheng said Han’s suggestions to either tell pollsters they don’t know or that they support Tsai were “laughable and ignorant”, and that Han was only trying to make himself feel better. “The most real public opinion is on the streets, in the parks, temples and market. Unless Han Kuo-yu hides at home and doesn’t go out, how can he not hear or see the change in public opinion?,” Lo wrote on his Facebook page. Opinion polls for Taiwan elections are traditionally seen as being unreliable, due to the highly partisan nature of Taiwan’s media and politics, though most of the recent polls have Han behind Tsai.

It paid well and I also felt that I was doing things for the country,"" he was quoted saying.""At the time the word 'spy' didn't cross our minds. We just thought those things were the tasks we needed to do for the country.""Beginning work in 2014 with a listed Hong Kong company that he says was a front for Chinese military intelligence, Wang said those tasks involved organising the infiltration of universities and media to counter the city's pro-democracy movement, including through physical or cyber-attacks against dissidents.Wang told Australian media he personally helped organise the October 2015 kidnapping of Lee Bo, owner of a Hong Kong bookshop that Beijing said distributed dissident materials.Four other bookshop employees were also spirited away to the mainland that year.- 'I will be dead' -But Wang told Australian media the final straw was an order to deploy this year -- under a fake South Korea passport -- to Taiwan for covert interference in their 2020 elections, with the aim of toppling President Tsai Ing-wen, whom Beijing despises for her anti-China views.Wang related staring at the faked passport and feeling as though he stood on a personal precipice, at the bottom of which he saw ""a person without (a) real identity"".Disgusted by China's ruthless methods, Wang said he turned his back on his homeland, defecting to Australia where his wife was studying and living with their toddler son.But the personal price will be heavy.Wang claims his and his wife's families are loyal Communist Party members -- his father was a regional party official -- and could now face retaliation.""Once I was found out, then my safety would be at stake.

Certainly, these attempts to influence Taiwan's democratic process are of concern,"" said Brent Christensen, the de facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan.""We believe that malign actors are using disinformation campaigns to make people lose faith in democratic institutions,"" he told reporters in Taipei.Beijing has in recent months stepped up efforts to ""reunify"" what it considers a wayward province, flying regular bomber patrols around it and seeking to isolate it diplomatically.The United States, like most countries, has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but is bound by law to help provide the island with the means to defend itself. It is democratic Taiwan's strongest backer on the international stage.Christensen said any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including boycotts or embargoes, was of ""grave concern"" to the United States.Taiwan and the United States have very close ties, he added, noting this year's $10 billion in U.S. arms sales to the island.""We have, I believe, a strong relationship in security matters that we anticipate will only grow stronger.""Speaking later in the day, Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said China's military threat was growing.""China's military preparation against Taiwan has not been slowing down. In fact, it's been intensifying,"" he told reporters.President Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party is leading in the polls, ahead of her main rival, Han Kuo-yu of the China-friendly Kuomintang party.Tsai's government has repeatedly warned of Beijing's campaign to influence the vote, including snatching more of Taiwan's few remaining diplomatic allies and a ""warfare"" of disinformation to mislead voters.Chinese President Xi Jinping said in January that China reserved the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control but would strive to achieve peaceful ""reunification"".Beijing suspects Tsai of pushing for the island's formal independence, which Xi has warned would lead to a ""grave disaster"".China described the carrier sailing as routine and not aimed at anyone in particular, dismissing Taiwan's complaints.Taiwan has lost seven diplomatic allies to China since Tsai took office in 2016, leaving 15 nations that recognise the island.China has sent about 2,000 bomber patrols a year to the narrow Taiwan Strait separating the two sides, the island's defence minister, Yen Teh-fa, told parliament last week.
