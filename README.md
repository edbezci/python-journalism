__This workshop introduces a hands-on experience in Python for data collection, web scrapping for data, error handling and analysis with algorithms. This workshop helps students to set up and get familiar with Python and use  data to explore a specific topic for research purposes. To do so, this workshop introduces some algorithms as well, such as Rapid Automated Keyword Extraction (RAKE),  and data processing practices in Python.__

## Setting up the Scene:
We will use Jupyter Notebooks as an interactive Python enviroment. The code and content used during this workshop will be free to access.
